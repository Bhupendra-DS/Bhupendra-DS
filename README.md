## Featured Project

### Bengaluru Traffic Optimization System

A full-stack machine learning application that helps students in Bengaluru plan their commutes using AI-powered traffic predictions. The system combines historical traffic data with real-time Google Maps information to provide accurate travel time estimates.

**Key Features:**
- Hybrid ML prediction system using Random Forest and LightGBM models
- Real-time Google Maps integration for route optimization
- Explainable AI with human-readable prediction explanations
- FastAPI backend with RESTful API design
- React + TypeScript frontend with modern UI/UX
- Production-ready architecture with proper error handling

**Tech Stack:** Python, FastAPI, React, TypeScript, Scikit-learn, LightGBM, Tailwind CSS, Google Maps API

**Impact:** Solves real-world traffic congestion problems for students, demonstrating practical ML application in Ed-Tech domain.
